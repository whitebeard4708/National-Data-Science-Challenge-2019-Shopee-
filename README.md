The whole dataset is divided into 3 parts: Beauty, Fashion, Mobile due to names of the files containing the images
3 different models were created to train these 3 datasets, each gave a unique accuracy and using some different techniques such as:
* Neural Network
* Support Vector Machine
* CountVectorizer
* TfidfVectorizer

In general, the overall accuracy is 74.4%, which only 6% less than top 1 model
